// The ``Session`` interface allows API clients to manage session tokens including creating, deleting and obtaining information about sessions.
//
//
//
// * The Session#create method creates session token in exchange for another authentication token.
// * The Session#delete method invalidates a session token.
// * The Session#get retrieves information about a session token.
//
//
//
//  The call to the Session#create method is part of the overall authentication process for API clients. For example, the sequence of steps for establishing a session with SAML token is:
//
// * Connect to lookup service.
// * Discover the secure token service (STS) endpoint URL.
// * Connect to the secure token service to obtain a SAML token.
// * Authenticate to the lookup service using the obtained SAML token.
// * Discover the API endpoint URL from lookup service.
// * Call the Session#create method. The Session#create call must include the SAML token.
//
//
//
//  See the programming guide and samples for additional information about establishing API sessions.
//
//  **Execution Context and Security Context**
//
//  To use session based authentication a client should supply the session token obtained through the Session#create method. The client should add the session token in the security context when using SDK classes. Clients using the REST API should supply the session token using the ``vmware-api-session-id`` HTTP header field.
//
//  **Session Lifetime**
//
//  A session begins with call to the Session#create method to exchange a SAML token for a API session token. A session ends under the following circumstances:
//
// * Call to the Session#delete method.
// * The session expires. Session expiration may be caused by one of the following situations:
//
//     * Client inactivity - For a particular session identified by client requests that specify the associated session ID, the lapsed time since the last request exceeds the maximum interval between requests.
//     * Unconditional or absolute session expiration time: At the beginning of the session, the session logic uses the SAML token and the system configuration to calculate absolute expiration time.
//
//
//
//  When a session ends, the authentication logic will reject any subsequent client requests that specify that session. Any operations in progress will continue to completion.
//
//  **Error Handling**
//
//  The Session returns the following exceptions:
//
// * vapiStdErrors_.Unauthenticated exception for any exceptions related to the request.
// * vapiStdErrors_.ServiceUnavailable exception for all exceptions caused by internal service failure.

	//  Please check the following preconditions if using a SAML token to authenticate:
	//
	// * the supplied token is delegate-able.
	// * the time of client and server system are synchronized.
	// * the token supplied is valid.
	// * if bearer tokens are used check that system configuration allows the API endpoint to accept such tokens.
	// @throws ServiceUnavailable  if session creation fails due to server specific issues, for example connection to a back end component is failing. Due to the security nature of this API further details will not be disclosed in the exception. Please refer to component health information, administrative logs and product specific documentation for possible causes.

	//
	// @throws Unauthenticated  if the session id is missing from the request or the corresponding session object cannot be found.
	// @throws ServiceUnavailable  if session deletion fails due to server specific issues, for example connection to a back end component is failing. Due to the security nature of this API further details will not be disclosed in the exception. Please refer to component health information, administrative logs and product specific documentation for possible causes.
